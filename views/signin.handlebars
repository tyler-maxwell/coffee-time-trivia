    <p>
        Welcome to Coffee Time Trivia. A trivia game where you can add your own questions about anything and
        everything. You can
        start answering trivia questions right away. Just login grab a cup of your favorite Joe and start answering.
        Once
        you have started the questions will come at you randomly, so you do not have to worry about them coming in the
        same
        order every time you play. The system will remember your answers and try to match you with new and challenging
        questions
        every time.</p>
    <p>
        If you decide that you want to contribute to our community, you can always add your own questions to the
        catalog for other
        Coffee Time Trivia players. Just simply submit your question(s) and answer(s) to the site, they will
        automatically
        be approved and added to the queue of questions. All players then get the opportunity to vote on your submitted
        questions.
        You will not be asked to answer your own question nor can you vote on your submitted question(s). You will be
        asked
        and allowed to vote on questions that others have posted. As long as people up-vote your question it stays in
        the
        game for all users to enjoy. As soon as your question gets enough downvotes to override any up-votes, it is
        removed
        from the trivia question list. Have fun and enjoy your Coffee trivia break!

                    <h5>Introduction:</h5>
                    <p>What is The Coffee Trivia Game? This is a trivia game where you can add your own questions and
                        have an interactive part in the building of the database. </p>
                    <p>You will be able to create your own account and login. You can start answering trivia questions
                        right away. Once you have created a log in with your Username and Password you can start
                        answering your randomly selected questions.</p>
                    <p>The system will remember your answers and vary the questions that you are asked every time to
                        keep the experience new and exciting.</p>
                    <p>We wanted to provide the end users an interaction that would produce Buy-In to the app. We did
                        this by allowing the User to submit their own questions. The User Submission area will allow
                        the user to provide a question and 4 multiple choice answers (indicating which answer is
                        correct). The new question will be added to the Catalog for users to play.</p>
                    <p>From here these questions will be presented to the other users on the site and they can vote on
                        the Questions.</p>
                    <p>Some regulatory actions were built into the App for safe guard of the Question selection
                        process.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You will not be asked to answer or vote on your own question.</li>
                        <li>Questions are presented one at a time, after the user answers the question they are given
                            the voting options.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Voting process:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>As long as people up-vote your question it stays in the game for all users to enjoy.</li>
                        <li>When your question reaches a 50% down-voting it will be removed from the active question
                            queue and placed in a pending status for the creator to review and correct.</li>
                        <li>How the voting is calculated. As soon as your question gets 50 total votes the system will
                            begin calculating the percentage of down-votes, if the question has received 50% or more
                            down-votes it is moved to the pending status parking lot.</li>

                    <p>Primary Key: Allows us to know who created the question so we do not show this question to them
                        in game play.</p>
                    <p>User table: stores the username, pw, correct/incorrect guess count.</p>
                    <p>Rounds table: This is a reference table that stores both foreign keys, userID and questionID,
                        allowing the App to cross-reference the question to the user. This is so that way the App does
                        not repeat a question to the same user.</p>
